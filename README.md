# AERSP597 - Ani Perumalla

This repository contains all files I used for the final project for AERSP597 (System Identification) in Spring 2021.

* `collect_data.py` - Python script used to simulate the motion of the car repeatedly and save the measured state at each timestep
* `plot_data_bulk.py` - Python script used to visualize the state response of the car for a few simulations
* `run_lsq_mi` - Matlab script used to perform the least-squares identification to find the mass and moment of inertia
* `run_lsq_cc` - Matlab script used to perform the least-squares identification to find the tire cornering stiffnesses
* `aersp597-SysID_Project.pdf` - PDF of the final report
